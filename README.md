# Statistical Modelling For Wine Data Analysis
 Data used: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
Objective:
* use of Bayesian Statistics for comparison of different group of wines:
*   - Data preprocessing using Tidyverse;
*   - Exploring and visualizing the data using ggplot;
*   - Estimate model parameters using a Gibbs sampler;
*   - Assess the sampler performance visually;
*   - Interpret the model output.
* fit a linear regression model focusing on frequentist inference
*   - data preprocessing and EDA including imputation of missing data
*   - deriving new fields of data using existing data columns
*   - selection of important features using Boruta and stepwise linear regression
*   - comparison of different models using AIC/BIC and different error metrics.
